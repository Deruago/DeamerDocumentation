# How To Create An LPD

Creating LPD's is the process of designing and developing new types of definitions. E.g. creating a new type of Lexicon LPD, that others can implement.

This file will go over the various things you need to do, to successfully create integrate your new LPD.

Creating a new LPD requires some boilerplate to be implemented (We want to reduce this in the future):

- Create the LPD class
- Create the LDO classes
- Integrate the LPD and LDO's, with the convertors and validators
- Create a LPD generator
- Try implementing it, and creating an extension for it!
